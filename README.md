# MindMapp

A tiny single-page mind mapping application. Nodes are stored in your browser's
`localStorage` as JSON and can be exported to a file.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Use the text field to add nodes. Select the parent node to nest items.
3. Data is persisted automatically. Use **Export JSON** to download the current
   map.
